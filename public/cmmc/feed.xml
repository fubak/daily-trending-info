We love seeing how everyone shares what's working for them and what's not.

We love to see it! This community and our discord community have always been about open sharing of information amongst fellow practitioners and straight up people who just need some help. We love seeing how everyone shares what's working for them and what's not. Recently, we've seen a handful of threads start with people wanting to share their Certification experience and their lessons learned - this is fantastic. But, if you aren't on /r/CMMC frequently, you will miss these threads. So, I want to create a mega-thread to collect these experiences in one spot where people can share their experiences and others can ask questions. If you were planning to post a whole thread about your experience, I encourage you to instead post here. We aren't preventing anyone from posting a separate thread, but think it's best to keep most of those types of posts here for the reasons stated above. Congrats to everyone who has passed so far! For those who are scheduled, my main advice: relax. If you found this community, there's a good chance you're taking this as seriously as you should, and that means you're probably going to pass. Notes You are welcome to name the names of the tools you used, the service providers that helped you, the consultants who guided you, the C3PAO that assessed you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Cmmc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CMMC/comments/1owyb9a/we_passed_our_cmmc_assessment_and_heres_what_we/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>CMMC consultants: What got you your first 3 paying clients?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1pwwg6b/cmmc_consultants_what_got_you_your_first_3_paying/</link><description>submitted by /u/ElliottWrites [link] [comments]</description><category>cmmc_reddit_nistcontrols</category><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1pwwg6b/cmmc_consultants_what_got_you_your_first_3_paying/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:56:42  +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>DailyTrending.info</dc:creator><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;CMMC consultants: What got you your first 3 paying clients?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;submitted by /u/ElliottWrites [link] [comments]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Nistcontrols&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1pwwg6b/cmmc_consultants_what_got_you_your_first_3_paying/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>NIST and MITRE partner to test AI defense technology for critical infrastructure</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1pvbojw/nist_and_mitre_partner_to_test_ai_defense/</link><description>submitted by /u/kraydit [link] [comments]</description><category>cmmc_reddit_nistcontrols</category><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1pvbojw/nist_and_mitre_partner_to_test_ai_defense/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:56:42  +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>DailyTrending.info</dc:creator><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;NIST and MITRE partner to test AI defense technology for critical infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;submitted by /u/kraydit [link] [comments]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Nistcontrols&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1pvbojw/nist_and_mitre_partner_to_test_ai_defense/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Pentagon names 6 appointees to lead the CTO’s top technology efforts</title><link>https://defensescoop.com/2026/01/30/dod-cto-critical-technology-areas-emil-michael-cta-appointees/</link><description>Here’s a first look at the new cadre tapped to accelerate projects across the DOD’s Critical Technology Areas.

I would just love to shoot a bridge over there but I'm not sure that is kosher or not or if there is any companies that have that equipment that is FIPS compliant. That brings me to my second question. Vendor/Brand/Gear. What is the go to for this installation. Currently we have Meraki and are on the Gov Dashboard. If we do option 1 we can easily do that with Meraki and call it a day. I do not believe though that Meraki has an option for option 2. Right now we do not have any wireless as it is. I know Ubiquiti has all kinds of PtP equipment, even a bridge under the Unifi brand. Lots under their WISP stuff. I do not believe any of their stuff is FIPS which means it's no good? Is there a way to have the bridge NOT be FIPS but the signal going to the bridge be FIPS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Cmmc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CMMC/comments/1qparvv/network_equipment_question_tale_of_two_options/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Pentagon wants ‘low-collateral’ drone interceptors at all U.S. military installations, task force director says</title><link>https://defensescoop.com/2026/01/28/drone-interceptors-us-military-installations-jiatf-401/</link><description>“I see us using low-collateral kinetic interceptors at all installations in the homeland,” Brig.

For example: "Access Control domain: ACME Corp's Access Control policy is detailed in the document 'ACME Corp Access Control Policy' ". However, it seems like our org's management wants to completely fold our CMMC policy book into an ISMS, and I have a feeling this may not be a great idea due to how big of a document that would be to hand off to a C3PAO (our ISMS covers a number of other ISO frameworks other than 27001). I'm leaning more towards having a separate ISMS and CMMC policy book, within which both refer to the same per-topic policies that address both the Annex A and CMMC controls. We'd still get the benefit of unified policies, but with a smaller policy book to hand off to a C3PAO. submitted by /u/GnawingPossum [link] [comments]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Cmmc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CMMC/comments/1qom0e7/unified_cmmc_27001_policies_in_isms/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>r/NISTControls Official Discord Group</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/10a1yn1/rnistcontrols_official_discord_group/</link><description>We recently had a jump in new members on the sub and the Mod team wanted to formally welcome and thank everyone for joining our community and chatting about all things NIST Controls related.

My dns service, across all my server's handling DNS is running as local system, which to my understanding is a pretty privileged account. the following will be an outline of what I've done so far. researching online I've found that it should be running as a virtual service account that I believe is configured by setting to run as "NT Authority\NetworkService" cool, I set that up, having to use sc.exe because the GUI won't allow me to put that account in there, which is fine, I prefer command line anyways. restart the dns service and get an "error 13 - the data is invalid" not super helpful, but I assume it's talking about some sort of file/registry permissions because I don't know what else would render data "invalid" except the referenced account not being able to read it. Do some research, find some references saying to give the account running DNS rights to system32/dns and HKLM:/system/currentcontrolset/services/dns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Nistcontrols&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1q6h66l/stig_question_259413_windows_dns_server/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>NIST adds to AI security guidance with Cybersecurity Framework profile</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1pqi5w8/nist_adds_to_ai_security_guidance_with/</link><description>submitted by /u/kraydit [link] [comments]</description><category>cmmc_reddit_nistcontrols</category><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1pqi5w8/nist_adds_to_ai_security_guidance_with/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:56:42  +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>DailyTrending.info</dc:creator><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;NIST adds to AI security guidance with Cybersecurity Framework profile&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;submitted by /u/kraydit [link] [comments]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Nistcontrols&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1pqi5w8/nist_adds_to_ai_security_guidance_with/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Lockheed Reports $75B in 2025 Sales; Jim Taiclet on DOW Agreements for PAC-3, THAAD Interceptors</title><link>https://www.govconwire.com/articles/lockheed-2025-sales-dow-pac-3-thaad-agreements</link><description>Lockheed Martin reported $75 billion in 2025 sales, up 6 percent from $71 billion recorded the previous year, and ended the year with a record backlog of $194 billion.

Looking for any pointers or tips on how to get started. submitted by /u/treasurebath18 [link] [comments]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Cmmc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CMMC/comments/1qr72rf/cmmc_training_academy/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>800-171 Megathread Series Hub</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/au1zs8/800171_megathread_series_hub/</link><description>Hey everybody, This hub thread is for all of the control categories of NIST SP 800-171. 3.1: Access Control 3.2: Awareness and Training 3.3: Audit and Accountability 3.4: Configuration Management 3.5: Identification and Authentication 3.6: Incident Response 3.7: Maintenance 3.8: Media Protection 3.9: Personnel Security 3.10: Physical Protection submitted by /u/medicaustik [link] [comments]</description><category>cmmc_reddit_nistcontrols</category><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/au1zs8/800171_megathread_series_hub/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:56:42  +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>DailyTrending.info</dc:creator><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;800-171 Megathread Series Hub&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody, This hub thread is for all of the control categories of NIST SP 800-171. 3.1: Access Control 3.2: Awareness and Training 3.3: Audit and Accountability 3.4: Configuration Management 3.5: Identification and Authentication 3.6: Incident Response 3.7: Maintenance 3.8: Media Protection 3.9: Personnel Security 3.10: Physical Protection submitted by /u/medicaustik [link] [comments]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Nistcontrols&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/au1zs8/800171_megathread_series_hub/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>CMMC &amp; Linux</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1qk1bsc/cmmc_linux/</link><description>submitted by /u/Visible_Cantaloupe33 [link] [comments]</description><category>cmmc_reddit_nistcontrols</category><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1qk1bsc/cmmc_linux/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:56:42  +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>DailyTrending.info</dc:creator><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;CMMC &amp; Linux&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;submitted by /u/Visible_Cantaloupe33 [link] [comments]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Nistcontrols&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1qk1bsc/cmmc_linux/"&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>NIST standards regarding outside plant hardware/software</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1q7ilw7/nist_standards_regarding_outside_plant/</link><description>Hello, We are a small Telco/Broadband company in rural Arkansas. We have 122 cards in our subscriber network rings that handle copper connectivity. Those cards use SSH 1.1 for encryption making them out of compliance with NIST 2.0, and there is not a replacement/upgrade option. How would you all handle that in regard to your documentation in case of an audit by the FCC? I am new to Cybersecurity and want as much input as I can get.
